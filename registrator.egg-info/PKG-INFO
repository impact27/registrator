Description: ## Synopsis
        
        This python3 code does image registration for microfluidics devices. The scale, rotation and position between two images is extracted 
        
        ## Code Example
        load the module
        
        : import registration.channel as cr
        
        Get a channel direction
        
        : an0=cr.channel_angle(im0)
        
        Get a channel width
        
        : width0=cr.channel_width(im0,chanangle=an0)
        
        Compare two images
        
        : angle, scale, origin, im2=cr.register_channel(im0,im1)
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Between series of images, the device mignt have moved, of the focal distance might have changed. 
        This project will automatically detect these differences.
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        This project require python3, openCV 3 and the python openCV interface
        
        On a mac with HomeBrew:
        
        : brew install python3
        
        : brew install opencv3 --with-python3
        
        : ln -s /usr/local/opt/opencv3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/cv2.cpython-35m-darwin.so /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/cv2.so
        
        ## API Reference
        
        The python help function gives the required infos as docstrings have been specified.
        
        : help(cr)
        
        
        ## Tests
        
        The file registration_test runs a series of tests
